# PDF-to-Hebrew

Converting extracted PDF gibberish to Hebrew.
You will need a PDF which extracts to gibberish <>.txt file as the input file.

Currently supports English fixing (Were reversed, other languages will need further fixes).

Next step for this project is to convert directly from PDF to TXT, and after that maybe adding UI.
